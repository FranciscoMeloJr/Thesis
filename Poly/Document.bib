  abstract =	 {Programs using floating-point arithmetic are prone to accuracy problems caused by rounding and catastrophic cancellation. These phenomena provoke bugs that are notoriously hard to track down: the program does not necessarily crash and the results are not necessarily obviously wrong, but often subtly inaccurate. Further use of these values can lead to catastrophic errors. In this paper, we present a dynamic program analysis that supports the programmer in finding accuracy problems. Our analysis uses binary translation to perform every floating-point computation side by side in higher precision. Furthermore, we use a lightweight slicing approach to track the evolution of errors.  We evaluate our analysis by demonstrating that it catches wellknown floating-point accuracy problems and by analyzing the Spec CFP2006 floating-point benchmark. In the latter, we show how our tool tracks down a catastrophic cancellation that causes a complete loss of accuracy leading to a meaningless program result. Finally, we apply our program to a complex, real-world bioinformatics application in which our program detected a serious cancellation. Correcting the instability led not only to improved quality of the result, but also to an improvement of the program's run time.},

This is particularly important if hardware limits for the precision of computations exist, which is just the case for graphic processors. A history of development of the cores of graphic cards is analyzed together with the idea of general purpose computing using GPU's (GPGPU). Special attention has been paid to efficiency and precision of computations. The so-called maximum accuracy property has been analyzed and technically realized with no additional costs in hardware and computation time. The proposed approach has been tested with illustrative frequency modulated sine waveform generators.},

  abstract =	 {High confidence in floating-point programs requires proving numerical properties of final and intermediate values. One may need to guarantee that a value stays within some range, or that the error relative to some ideal value is well bounded. This certification may require a time-consuming proof for each line of code, and it is usually broken by the smallest change to the code, e.g., for maintenance or optimization purpose. Certifying floating-point programs by hand is, therefore, very tedious and error-prone. The Gappa proof assistant is designed to make this task both easier and more secure, due to the following novel features: It automates the evaluation and propagation of rounding errors using interval arithmetic. Its input format is very close to the actual code to validate. It can be used incrementally to prove complex mathematical properties pertaining to the code. It generates a formal proof of the results, which can be checked independently by a lower level proof assistant like Coq. Yet it does not require any specific knowledge about automatic theorem proving, and thus, is accessible to a wide community. This paper demonstrates the practical use of this tool for a widely used class of floating-point programs: implementations of elementary functions in a mathematical library.},

This paper presents a tutorial on those aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating-point standard, and concludes with numerous examples of how computer builders can better support floating-point.},

Unfortunately, in some (catastrophic) situations, the floating-point operations lose so much precision that they quickly become irrelevant. In this article, we review some of the problems one can encounter, focussing on the IEEE754-1985 norm. We give a (sketch of a) semantics of its basic operations then abstract them (in the sense of abstract interpretation) to extract information about the possible loss of precision. The expected application is abstract debugging of software ranging from simple on-board systems (which use more and,more on-the-shelf micro-processors with floating-point units) to scientific codes. The abstract analysis is demonstrated on simple examples and compared with related work},

abstract="Tracing is a common method used to debug, analyze, and monitor various systems. Even though standard tools and tracing methodologies exist for standard and distributed environments, it is not the case for heterogeneous embedded systems. This paper proposes to fill this gap and discusses how efficient tracing can be achieved without having common system tools, such as the Linux Trace Toolkit (LTTng), at hand on every core. We propose a generic solution to trace embedded heterogeneous systems and overcome the challenges brought by their peculiar architectures (little available memory, bare-metal CPUs, or exotic components for instance). The solution described in this paper focuses on a generic way of correlating traces among different kinds of processors through traces synchronization, to analyze the global state of the system as a whole. The proposed solution was first tested on the Adapteva Parallella board. It was then improved and thoroughly validated on TI's Keystone 2 System-on-Chip (SoC).",

  abstract =	 {An unsound claim can misdirect a field, encouraging the pursuit of unworthy ideas and the abandonment of promising ideas. An inadequate description of a claim can make it difficult to reason about the claim, for example to determine whether the claim is sound. Many practitioners will acknowledge the threat of un- sound claims or inadequate descriptions of claims to their field. We believe that this situation is exacerbated and even encouraged by the lack of a systematic approach to exploring, exposing, and addressing the source of unsound claims and poor exposition.
  This paper proposes a framework that identifies three sins of reasoning that lead to unsound claims and two sins of exposition that lead to poorly described claims. Sins of exposition obfuscate the objective of determining whether or not a claim is sound, while sins of reasoning lead directly to unsound claims.
  Our framework provides practitioners with a principled way of critiquing the integrity of their own work and the work of others. We hope that this will help individuals conduct better science and encourage a cultural shift in our research community to identify and promulgate sound claims.}

  abstract = {Recent work in supervised learning has shown that a surprisingly simple Bayesian classifier with strong assumptions of independence among features, called naive Bayes, is competitive with state-of-the-art classifiers such as C4.5.  This fact raises the question of whether a classifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even better. In this paper we evaluate approaches for inducing classifiers from data, based on the theory of learning
    Bayesian networks.  These networks are factored representations of probability distributions that generalize the naive Bayesian classifier and explicitly represent statements about independence.  Among these approaches we single out a method we call Tree Augmented Naive Bayes (TAN), which outperforms naive Bayes, yet at the same time maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved) and robustness that characterize naive Bayes. We experimentally tested these approaches, using problems from the University of California at Irvine repository, and compared them to C4.5, naive Bayes, and wrapper methods for feature selection}
