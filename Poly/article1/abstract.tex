Performance has become more important on software development and maintenance. To address this concern, teams of developers use tracing tools to improve the performance or track performance related bugs. On this work we developed an automated technique to find the cause of performance issues, which do not require deep knowledge of the system. This approach is capable to indicate the performance cause using a comparative methodology on slow and fast executions. We applied the solution on some use cases and were able to find the specific cause of them. Also, we implemented the solution on a framework to help developers on similar problems together with a differential flame graph tool.
