This section discusses the threats to the validity of our study.\\
\textbf{Time analysis}
    Our approach is based on comparing several clusters to take the best according to the SSE, which requires a comparatively long period of time. Our study aims to use an automated non-supervised clustering method, thus the analysis time is a minor factor if it is less than human analysis. Although the analysis required just a few minutes between building the ECCT tree and the classifying the metrics. Another highlight is that the analysis is made offline, so the time will not influence on the performance of the software and does not require stopping the software development.
    
\textbf{Quantity of groups}
    Considering the automated heuristic used can give a high number of groups for evaluation. This process can increase the difficult for evaluation.
